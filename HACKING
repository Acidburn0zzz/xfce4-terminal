Bug tracking system
===================

Terminal uses the bug tracking system at http://bugs.os-cillation.de/
hosted and maintained by os-cillation.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same
   as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is
   necessary!


Release process
===============

 1) Check out a fresh copy from Subversion
 2) Increment the version number in configure.ac
 3) Update NEWS and ChangeLog, and don't forget to add an entry
    ("Released x.y.z") to ChangeLog, so people can see which changes
    were before and after a given release.
 4) Update doc/*/Terminal.xml. Also update the figures in doc/*/images
    if the UI has changed. Run "make html" in doc/*/.
 5) Verify that make dist works.
 6) "svn commit" the changes.
 7) Create a simple tag for the release,
      "svn copy http://os-cillation.de:8080/repos/terminal/trunk \
         http://os-cillation.de:8080/repos/terminal/tags/release-X.Y.Z"
    where X.Y.Z is the version number.
 8) upload the tarball to os-cillation ftp
 9) Update freshmeat entry.
