Bug tracking system
===================

Terminal uses the bug tracking system at http://bugs.os-cillation.de/
hosted and maintained by os-cillation.


Patches
=======

Please submit patches to the os-cillation bug tracking system or to the
people listed in the AUTHORS file. Your patch should be in unified diff
format (the -u option to GNU diff).

Please and send a patch against a recent version of this package. Patches
against the Subversion trunk branch are most preferable. You can always
access the trunk branch from 

  https://os-cillation.com:8080/websvn/listing.php?repname=terminal


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the os-cillation bug tracking system
(http://bugs.os-cillation.com, product Terminal) with a Severity of
enhancement. Make sure that your feature request wasn't reported already
before; requesting a feature several times won't increase the chance
that it gets added.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same
   as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is
   necessary!
 - Don't follow the philosophy "If it works, it's right" that most
   open source projects follow, instead Terminal's philosophy is
   "It doesn't work unless it's right".


Release process

  2) Increment the version number in configure.ac
  3) Update NEWS, README and ChangeLog, and don't forget to add an entry

     if the UI has changed. Run "make html" in doc/*/.

     where X.Y.Z is the version number.
