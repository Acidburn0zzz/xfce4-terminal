- The compact mode functionality was split up into 2 options, its now possible
  to toggle the visibility of the menubar and the window decorations inde-
  pendently.
- New icons for Open Terminal and Open Tab, designed by Francois Le
  Clainche <fleclainche@wanadoo.fr>.

  rather useless, now that Terminal offers -x/--execute command line
  options.
- The output of Terminal --help was improved to list all options with
  descriptions of their functionality.
- The Preferences dialog was changed to use GtkFrame instead of XfceFramebox
  to get a smoother look.

  german translations are available.
