0.2.1svn
========
- A command line option --fullscreen was added to put a new window into
  fullscreen mode automatically.
- Users can open only one preferences dialog per terminal window now.
- The shortcut for the commandline option --title is now -T, because thats
  seems to be common among terminal emulators. -t is still supported for
  compatbility with gnome-terminal, but may be removed in the future.
- Remote displays are supported properly now. But multi-screen mode will only
  work with solid background until the Vte guys fix the multi-screen issue
  (see http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160782).
- Modifiers like <Mod2> or <Lock> are now stripped off when using the
  shortcut editor, since it turned out that they don't work properly with
  some X setups.
- Pressing Shift<F10> also pops up the right-click menu now.
- Fixed a bug where the size was not always properly set when opening a
  new terminal tab.
- A new toplevel menu "Go" was added, which includes "Prev Tab", "Next Tab"
  and a list of currently active tabs. People who use a customized Terminal.ui
  will need to sync their copy with the default Terminal.ui file in order
  to see this change.
- New shortcuts have been added to allow fast switching to the first 9
  terminal tabs; the shortcut defaults to Alt+#.
- The terminal tab close button is now properly rendered with Gtk+ themes
  based on the "pixmap" engine.
- New translations: Dwayne Bailey (en_GB), Hydonsingore Sie (zh_TW)


0.2.0
=====
- The user interface was reworked to comply with the GNOME Human Interface
  Guidelines (HIG).
- Terminal can now use the foreground and background color from the selected
  Gtk+ theme.
- Toolbars can now be edited by right-clicking the appriorate toolbar.
- The preferences dialog and the title dialog are now accessible.
- Avoid flickering when opening a new terminal.
- The terminal background is now set up before the terminal is mapped on
  screen.
- Menu access keys can now be disabled, which allows passing key combinations
  such as Alt+f to the application running inside the terminal.
- Font-antialiasing can now be turned off for the terminal font rendering,
  which impressively speeds up Terminal performance and reduces system
  load on slow systems.
- Optional support for startup notification was added.
- A bunch of new command line options were added, which allow the user
  to control every aspect of a terminal window from the command line and
  its also possible to open multiple windows and multiple tabs from the
  command line.
- The terminal title can now be changed by double-clicking the terminal
  tab header.
- Multi-screen and multi-display configurations are now properly supported
  by Terminal.
- A bug in the backspace binding preference was fixed, which caused Terminal
  to use Control+H if the user configured ASCII DEL and vice versa.
- Support for session management was added (using X11R5 WM_SAVE_YOURSELF).
- Added a confirmation dialog, that pops up when a window with more than
  one tab is about to be closed. The confirmation can be disabled from
  the dialog.
- Icons are now built into the Terminal binary to avoid the 100-500ms
  increase in startup time when using the icon lookup functions in
  libxfcegui4.
- If an application running inside the terminal supports using the
  mouse (like mc for example), Terminal automatically disables the
  right-click menu and forwards all button clicks to the application
  instead. Hold down shift while pressing the right mouse button to
  get a right-click menu in this situation.
- Several bugfixes and improvements have been integrated into Terminal
  (in order to reduce code-size and startup time).
- The D-BUS interface was changed to include a version number and to
  pass the argument vector instead of the parsed options to the
  Terminal service.
- The online documentation and the manual page have been updated.


0.1.10
======
- The configure option --enable-final is now on by default for plattforms
  that support it.
- A bunch of new icons was imported.
- Terminal now includes an editable toolbar, which is disabled by default.

  Scaled, Stretched and Centered). In addition the background image chooser
  dialog now features a preview widget and an `Image files' filter.
- Various resize-related bugs have been addressed and fixed.
- Terminal now defaults to current working directory if no --working-directory
  command line switch was specified.
- The documentation was updated and a manual page for Terminal was added.


0.1.9
=====
- The configure option --enable-final now enables linker optimizations for
  plattforms that support it (recent GNU binutils required).

  in image and transparent mode.

- Added documentation for Terminal, available through the menu Help->Contents
  and available online at http://www.os-cillation.de/documentation/terminal/

  to toggle the visibility of the menubar and the window decorations inde-
  pendently.
- New icons for Open Terminal and Open Tab, designed by Francois Le

- The output of Terminal --help was improved to list all options with
  descriptions of their functionality.
- The Preferences dialog was changed to use GtkFrame instead of XfceFramebox
  to get a smoother look.
